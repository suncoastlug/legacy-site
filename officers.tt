		<p>As with any group, someone has to handle the chores involved in keeping the group running and alive. Those are the <em>officers</em> of the group. Below is a list of the officers of this group and their duties. Some of these positions are filled, and some people hold more than one office. These jobs aren't glamorous, and you don't get paid for them. Your reward is the satisfaction that you've done something (hopefully) effective to keep the group alive and doing well. If you think you could help out, don't hesitate to <a href="volunteer.html">volunteer</a>!</p>

		<h3>Dylan Hardison - President</h3>
		<p>It's the President's job to ensure that the group runs smoothly, and that the duties of the other officers get done effectively. This means that if one of the other officers is absent, leaves or quits, his duties fall to the President to do. He also acts as the spokesman and public representative of the group. And the President acts as adjudicator of disputes among officers and members. And since his job is to ensure that the other officers do their jobs, he may step in to handle an officer's job where that officer has failed to do it effectively.</p>
		
		<h3>Bill Davison - Vice-President</h3>
		<p>The Vice-President acts in the President's stead where he is not available, is incapacitated, or indisposed.</p>
		
		<h3>Bill Davison - Treasurer</h3>
		<p>The Treasurer handles the money and physical assets of the group. We do not have dues, but we do accept donations. It's the Treasurer's job to ensure we have money, that it's spent in accordance with the wishes of the group, and that it is well-accounted for. The Treasurer is a signatory on the group's bank account.</p>

		<h3>Collective Git Hub - Webmaster</h3>
		<p>The Webmaster maintains and updates the website. His job is to ensure that the content of the website is up to date, and that the next meeting is announced on the website in advance of the event. He should maintain and not cut corners on the content, and should ensure that the website is first and foremost informative. Appearance is secondary, and in no case should the website ever be Lynx-unfriendly.</p>
	
		<h3>Dylan Hardison - List Administrator</h3>
		<p>This person's job is first, to ensure we have one or more lists for use by the members. Secondly, he or she must maintain the subscription database and subscribe and unsubscribe members as needed. Lastly, he or she must monitor the lists to ensure that the charter for the lists are followed, and take any action within the charter to ensure this.</p>

		<h3>As needed - Event Coordinator</h3>
		<p>This person ensures that meetings take place on a regular (at least monthly) schedule and are promoted effectively to members. He or she shall also bring the meetings and events to order and act as master of ceremonies. He may not use meetings as his personal forum for voicing his own opinions and prejudices. It is also his job to ensure that meetings are well attended, and that there are good reasons for members to attend. This would generally entail (among other things) lining up interesting speakers and presenters for meetings.</p>
